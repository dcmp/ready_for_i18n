= ready_for_i18n

ready_for_i18n is a handy tool in the first step of transfering your local 
Rails project to an i18n one.

It will automatically extract hard-coded text from your ERB view file,
then choose a proper key and replace them with the I18n.translate method.

Currently two extractors are available:

* TextExtractor will scan all text nodes in you HTML document, like &lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; then replace it with <%=t(:text_hello)%>.
* LabelExtractor will scan all the text in helper methods like link_to('Login'...) and replace with link_to (t(:login)).

== Basic Command Line Usage:
  ready_for_i18n <path to ERB source files> <target path> 

Your erb files in source path will be transformed(i18n_ready)
and copy to target file path,together with a locale file 'en.yml'.

Using the following options:
        --locale [LOCALE]            Generating for the specified locale (default locale 'en')
        --ext [EXTENSION]            The file extension name of your views(default '.html.erb')

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
